# weight-height-convertor
It's a python code. In which we used if conditions to solve this. This Python script, weight-heightconversion.ipynb, offers a simple and interactive way to convert between common units of weight and height. Users can input their measurements in either pounds or kilograms for weight, and meters or feet for height. The script then processes this input, performing the necessary conversions and displaying the results. It's a practical example demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional logic (if-elif-else statements), and basic arithmetic operations within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The code also includes checks to ensure that the entered weight and height values are positive, providing error messages for invalid inputs.
